# A Theoretical Analysis of the Datasets
The provided dataset contains 21 variables and 2,864 rows of data about life expectancy, health, immunization, and economic and demographic information for 179 countries from 2000-2015. The dataset was collected from various sources including Kaggle, World Bank Data, World Health Organization, and Our World in Data, and underwent a process of cleaning and filling in missing data.

The dataset also includes a variable that categorizes countries into developed and developing categories based on their Gross National Income per capita. The aim of the dataset is to build a model to predict life expectancy based on the provided factors.

The dataset provides a rich source of information for exploring the relationship between various factors and life expectancy. The dataset is relatively large and contains a mix of continuous and categorical variables, which provides an opportunity for applying different machine learning techniques.

Overall, the dataset is well-suited for exploring the relationship between various factors and life expectancy, and can be a valuable resource for building predictive models to improve public health outcomes.

# What will the model predict?
The model will predict life expectancy, which is the average number of years that a newborn is expected to live in a given country, based on the various factors provided in the dataset. Life expectancy is a commonly used indicator of the health status of a population and is influenced by various factors such as access to healthcare, nutrition, education, income, and environmental conditions.

The dataset contains information about several factors that are known to impact life expectancy, including immunization rates, economic and demographic information, health indicators such as BMI, HIV incidents, and mortality rates, and education indicators such as schooling.

By building a model to predict life expectancy, we can gain insights into how various factors interact to impact the health outcomes of a population. This information can be used to inform public health policies and interventions aimed at improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities.
